## Developing

Installed dependencies with `pnpm install`, start a development server:

```sh
pnpm dev
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```sh
pnpm build
```

You can preview the production build with `pnpm preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.
